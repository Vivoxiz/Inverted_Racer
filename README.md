<h5> The Story of the Inverted Rider </h5>

<h5>Object of the Game</h5> 

THe main goal of the game is to avoid oncoming traffic.

There are two different possible objectives in the game, as there are two different modes. In one mode, you need to survive for a certain distance to reach an end, which is a roadblock created by police, without crashing and losing all three lives. 

The other mode is an endless mode, where you try to survive for the longest distance you can without losing all of your lives.
